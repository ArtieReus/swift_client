# SwiftClient

Small but powerful client to interact with OpenStack Swift.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'swift_client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install swift_client

## Usage

First, connect to a Swift cluster:

```ruby
swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://example.com/auth/v1.0",
  :username => "account:username",
  :api_key => "api key",
  :temp_url_key => "temp url key",
  :storage_url => "https://example.com/v1/AUTH_account"
)
```

To connect via v2 you have to add version and method specific details:

```ruby
swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v2.0",
  :storage_url => "https://storage.example.com/v1/AUTH_account",
  :tenant_name => "tenant",
  :username => "username",
  :password => "password"
)

# OR

swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v2.0",
  :storage_url => "https://storage.example.com/v1/AUTH_account",
  :tenant_name => "tenant",
  :access_key => "access key",
  :secret_key => "secret key"
)
```

To connect via v3:

```ruby
swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v3",
  :storage_url => "https://storage.example.com/v1/AUTH_account",
  :username => "username",
  :password => "password",
  :user_domain => "example.com" # :user_domain_id => "..." is valid as well
)

# OR

# project scoped authentication

swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v3",
  :username => "username",
  :password => "password",
  :user_domain => "example.com", # :user_domain_id => "..." is valid as well
  :project_id => "p-123456", # :project_name => "..." is valid as well
  :project_domain_id => "d-123456" # :project_domain_name => "..." is valid as well
)

# OR

# domain scoped authentication

swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v3",
  :username => "username",
  :password => "password",
  :user_domain => "example.com", # :user_domain_id => "..." is valid as well
  :domain_id => "d-123456" # :domain_name => "..." is valid as well
)

# OR

swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v3",
  :storage_url => "https://storage.example.com/v1/AUTH_account",
  :user_id => "user id",
  :password => "password"
)

# OR

swift_client = SwiftClient.new(
  :auth_url => "https://auth.example.com/v3",
  :storage_url => "https://storage.example.com/v1/AUTH_account",
  :token => "token"
)
```

where `temp_url_key` and `storage_url` are optional.

SwiftClient will automatically reconnect in case the endpoint responds with 401
Unauthorized to one of your requests using the provided credentials. In case
the endpoint does not respond with 2xx to any of SwiftClient's requests,
SwiftClient will raise a `SwiftClient::ResponseError`. Otherwise, SwiftClient
responds with an `HTTParty::Response` object, such that you can call `#headers`
to access the response headers or `#body` as well as `#parsed_response` to
access the response body and JSON response. Checkout the
[HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty) gem to learn more.

SwiftClient offers the following requests:

* head_account -> HTTParty::Response
* post_account(headers = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* head_containers -> HTTParty::Response
* get_containers(query = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* paginate_containers(query = {}) -> Enumerator
* get_container(container_name, query = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* paginate_container(container_name, query = {}) -> Enumerator
* head_container(container_name) -> HTTParty::Response
* put_container(container_name, headers = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* post_container(container_name, headers = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* delete_container(container_name) -> HTTParty::Response
* put_object(object_name, data_or_io, container_name, headers = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* post_object(object_name, container_name, headers = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* get_object(object_name, container_name) -> HTTParty::Response
* head_object(object_name, container_name) -> HTTParty::Response
* delete_object(object_name, container_name) -> HTTParty::Response
* get_objects(container_name, query = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* paginate_objects(container_name, query = {}) -> Enumerator
* public_url(object_name, container_name) -> HTTParty::Response
* temp_url(object_name, container_name, options = {}) -> HTTParty::Response
* bulk_delete(objects) -> objects
